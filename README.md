Welcome!

Lumina is the new SIGGD game determined for 2017. It is planned to be a first person fantasy dungeon crawling game, fine tuned to challenge the player as much as possible with adaptive AI and multiple gameplay challenges. 

The [creators and maintainers](/docs/GameCredits.md) are a diverse mix of software developers, designers, game testers, graphic artists, and musicians. We encourage others to join!

We encourage contributions from anybody and try to keep a warm and friendly community.

## Playing

Lumina requires Unity 5.5 or higher. [download it here](https://unity3d.com/)

We don't have official release yet, so now you can download project, open it and play around in Unity Editor

## Developing

We mostly use Unity 5.5 as the main game framework. We also use various graphics tools like Blender and audio tools.
